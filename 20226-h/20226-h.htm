<p>The bull&rsquo;s-eye watch that hung in view,</p>
<p>Ticking its weary circuit through,</p>
<p>Pointed with mutely-warning sign</p>
<p>Its black hand to the hour of nine.</p>
<p>That sign the pleasant circle broke:</p>
<p>My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,</p>

<p>Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray,</p>
<p>And laid it tenderly away,</p>
<p>Then roused himself to safely cover</p>
<p>The dull red brands with ashes over.</p>
<p>And while, with care, our mother laid</p>
<p>The work aside, her steps she stayed</p>
<p>One moment, seeking to express</p>
<p>Her grateful sense of happiness</p>
<p>For food and shelter, warmth and health,</p>
<p>And love&rsquo;s contentment more than wealth,</p>
<p>With simple wishes (not the weak,</p>

Within our beds awhile we heard</p>

<p>The wind that round the gables roared,</p>
<p>With now and then a ruder shock,</p>
<p>Which made our very bedsteads rock.</p>
<p>We heard the loosened clapboards tost,</p>
<p>The board-nails snapping in the frost;</p>
<p>And on us, through the unplastered wall,</p>
<p>Felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall.</p>
<p>But sleep stole on, as sleep will do</p>
<p>When hearts are light and life is new;</p>
<p>Faint and more faint the murmurs grew,</p>
<p>Till in the summer-land of dreams</p>
<p>They softened to the sound of streams,</p>
<p>Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars,</p>
<p>And lapsing waves on quiet shores.</p>

<p>Next morn we wakened with the shout</p>
<p>Of merry voices high and clear;</p>
<p>And saw the teamsters drawing near</p>
<p>To break the drifted highways out.</p>
<p>Down the long hillside treading slow</p>
